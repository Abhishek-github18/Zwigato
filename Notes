How react useEffect works 

Approach 1 - Loads ---> API --- Render
Approach 2 - Loads ---> Render ---> API ---> Re-render 
    Much better UI experience as we render first skeleton and then after API call renders the main code


useEffect follows Approach 2 

Hooks  - Js Function (provided by React)

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("This is use Effect callback method");
  }, []);

  the callback function of useEffect will be called as soon as the component in which it is present render , as soon as component renders useEffect cb function is executed.

  --------------
  const Body = () => {
  const [listOfRestaurant, setListOfRestaurant] = useState(resObj);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("This is useEffect callback method");
  }, []);

  console.log("OutSide useEffect");

  return (
    <div className="body">
--------------------------

first outside useEffect will be logged and then This is useEffect cb method

//shimmer UI

till the actual data render on the UI , we should use Shimmer ui on the screen
